# IMDbPro-Frontend-
A Simple web application to search movies and get information regarding that.
Here I made two HTML and same for JS so that when user enters any movie and he want to have more info of that particular movie , this will go to next webpage to show more info for that particular movie. CSS for both the page will be same.
Out HTML is divided into three section:- 
One is for IMDb heading, One is to search and display results and one is for favorites section.
We try to make it responsive as well as user friendly.
